# Introduction:
This report summarizes the key steps and results from a tutorial on building a binary classification model to predict if it will rain tomorrow based on today's weather data. The dataset used is the Rain in Australia dataset from Kaggle containing over 10 years of daily weather data from numerous locations in Australia. 

## Results: 
The data was split into training, validation and test sets. Numeric columns were imputed for missing values and scaled to a 0-1 range. Categorical columns were encoded as one-hot vectors. A logistic regression model was trained on the preprocessed inputs to predict the target variable RainTomorrow. On the test set, the model achieved an accuracy of 84.2%, significantly better than a random baseline of 50%. The model generalizes well, with similar accuracy on the validation set. 

Important features were location, temperature, humidity and pressure. These had the greatest effect on the prediction when varied individually. The entire workflow from data ingestion to model training and evaluation was implemented in Python using Pandas, Scikit-learn and other libraries. The model was saved to disk and can be used to make predictions on new weather data by applying the same preprocessing steps.

## Conclusion:
The tutorial demonstrated an end-to-end machine learning workflow for a binary classification problem, including data preprocessing, model training and evaluation. The logistic regression model was able to predict rain tomorrow with good accuracy. The model and approach can be extended to other weather prediction tasks.
